# Soc

Absolutely! Let’s break down these answers in a simple, easy-to-understand way, suitable for someone who’s just starting to learn about SOC and cybersecurity.

### **Basic Networking and Operating Systems**

1. **What is the OSI model, and can you describe each layer?**
   - Think of the OSI model as a recipe for how data travels from one computer to another. It has 7 layers:
     1. **Physical**: This is the hardware (like cables) that sends data.
     2. **Data Link**: This checks if data is sent correctly on the cable.
     3. **Network**: Decides the best path for the data to travel.
     4. **Transport**: Ensures data is sent and received properly.
     5. **Session**: Manages the connection between computers.
     6. **Presentation**: Translates data into a format computers can understand.
     7. **Application**: Where applications (like web browsers) use the data.

2. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is like sending a registered letter where you get confirmation that the letter was received. It ensures data arrives correctly and in order.
   - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is like sending a postcard. It’s faster but doesn’t guarantee the postcard will arrive or be in the right order.

3. **What are the common ports used for HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP?**
   - **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** uses port 80. It’s like a regular mail service for websites.
   - **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** uses port 443. It’s a secure version of HTTP, like sending mail with a lock.
   - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** uses port 21. It’s used to transfer files between computers.

4. **Can you explain the purpose of a firewall?**
